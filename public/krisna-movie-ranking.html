<h1>Moki's Best Movie (Top 3) of All Time</h1>
<h2>In no order in particular</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Chihayafuru</h3>
<p>Unique theme, unique concept of competitive highschool karuta environment</p>

<h3>Scott Pilgrim VS The World</h3>
<p>Everything about this movie is amazing (anything but Scott Pilgrim himself as character)</p>

<h3>Josee, Fish and The Tiger</h3>
<p>Best romance anime, with great soundtracks from Eve. Plus Josee had this Kansai accent, best female anime character in my opinion.</p>
